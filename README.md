Project I started during the end of 2019 and the beginning fo 2020. 

The first log of the website explains the project in concise detail:

"I, about week ago, began a conquest to combine the effectiveness of both Python's Django framework with Javascript ES6's React. I have successfully made an article page along with my paleontological profiles, which I have incorporated into almost every framework project. These pages include list views and detail views. The data put into the backend is summoned as an api using Django's REST framework. This data is then passed onto React to be used for frontend. Ant Design (the Bootstrap of React) was used for the website design itself. I hope to expand upon this more for it to become a plentiful Web Application."

I made this scrappy website out of Django + React when I was a freshman in high school and put together facts about animals and a log/journal for my personal website use
